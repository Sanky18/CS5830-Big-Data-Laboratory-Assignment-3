# Climatological Data Pipeline

This assignment aims to set up a data pipeline to acquire public domain climatological data from the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) website. The pipeline is divided into two main tasks: DataFetch Pipeline and Analytics Pipeline. It leverages Apache Airflow for task fetching and Apache Beam for data processing.

## Repository Structure

The Repository structure consists of the following directories and files:

- `dags/`: Contains Apache Airflow DAGs for task scheduling.
- `data/`: Directory for storing generated data.
- `plots/`: Directory for storing generated visualizations.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies.
- `docker-compose.yml`: Docker Compose file for containerized deployment.
- `dockerfile`: Dockerfile for building Docker images.
